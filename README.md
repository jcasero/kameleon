# Kameleon

## Introduction

Kameleon is an Android Experiment which is developed with the main purpose of show the developers how can they design a mutated app that changes according to the user activity. By now, the application creates a beautiful random background and set it as default background of an Android Wear device paired with the handheld. In a nearly future the application might change other stuff like show heartbit if the user is running or the speed velocity if the user is going by car, among other things.
